#  README for Keyboard Project (Main App)
The Keyboard Project App is built natively on Swift for the iOS platform. The database being used is Firebase Firestore.

# Things that should be further improved on:
## Important
1) Create a waveform around the recording button to show that recording is going on.
2) Save data in the case of students exiting the app accidentally/early. Partial data is not being recorded currently.
## Less Important
1) Instead of using a textfield and apple pencil, convert writing to finger writing (Tougher and requires more time).
2) Make homepage more appealing (?)

# External Packages used
1) Firebase iOS SDK (https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk) via SPM
2) CSV.swift (https://github.com/yaslab/CSV.swift) via SPM
